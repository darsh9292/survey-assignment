- Tools Used :
- Github Copilot

Process Breakdown:
1. Copy models and code from provided files
2. Created project and added as per folder structure
3. Used API propmt to generate code
4. Used API prompt to generate test cases

THE killer prompt :
Implement methods from ScoreCompositionService and use logic from processSurveyResponse(SurveyResponse surveyResponse, byte[] resumeFile) method from class SurveyResponseService

write coverage fot CentralScoringEngine

Challenges faced:
